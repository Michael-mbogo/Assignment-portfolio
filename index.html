    <p>Here are some of the projects i have been able to work on.</p>
    <p>To view one of the projects click <a href="https://github.com/Michael-mbogo/Dance-Project.git/">Here</a> The project is a about making people aware of <span>latin dances</span>. It breifly talks about what <span>latin dances</span> are and describes some of the <span>categories/types</span> of latin dances.</p>
    <p>Here is a second link to a second project click <a href="https://github.com/Michael-mbogo/cookie-recipe.git/">Here</a> This is a forked project from Iantheninja which included a cookie recipe. The project itself involed a badly indented and spaced html file and i had to correct the indentations and spacing as practise.</p>
